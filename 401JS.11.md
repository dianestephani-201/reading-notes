1. **Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms).** A software [design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern#:~:text=In%20software%20engineering%2C%20the%20singleton,mathematical%20concept%20of%20a%20singleton.) that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.
1. **Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes.** Can be used for logging and database [connections](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/singleton-design-pattern-introduction/).
1. **If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?** 



- **Router Middleware -** provides services to [applications](https://medium.com/@pragyan88/writing-middleware-composition-and-currying-elegance-in-javascript-8b15c98a541b) beyond what's available in the operating system.
- **Dynamic Module Loading -** turns a module into an [object](https://javascript.info/modules-dynamic-imports) that contains all of its exports.
- **Singleton Pattern -** restricts a class to a single instance.
- **CRUD → REST Method Matches -** post/create, get/read, put/update/replace, patch/update/modify, [delete/delete](https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html#:~:text=The%20primary%20or%20most%2Dcommonly,but%20are%20utilized%20less%20frequently.).
- **Mock Testing -** objects that replace real [objects](https://stackabuse.com/using-mocks-for-testing-in-javascript-with-sinon-js/#:~:text=Introduction,being%20tested%20will%20be%20used.&text=js%20to%20mock%20an%20HTTP,unit%20testing%20techniques%20with%20Sinon.) when testing their functions.
