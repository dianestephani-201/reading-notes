# Bearer Authorization

1. **Steps written in order:**
- Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret.
- Receive authorization code.
- Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party.
- Make a request to a third-party API endpoint.
- Receive access token.
- Make a request to the access token endpoint.
- Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint.

1. **What can you do with an authorization code?** You can access whatever level of information the code permits.
1. **What can you do with an access token?** Access tokens allow an application to access an API, and they also allow a user to log in to services using another platform, such as Facebook.
1. **Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?** I think it's more secure to use OAuth, and it's easier for the user to log in without having to provide all their information to a new service.
