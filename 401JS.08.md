# Express Routing & Connected API

1. **Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware.** To validate parameters, to define multiple requests on one route, and to [process](https://scotch.io/tutorials/learn-to-use-the-new-router-in-expressjs-4) requests.
1. **True or false: The route handler is middleware?** True.
1. **In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?** When [validating](https://scotch.io/tutorials/learn-to-use-the-new-router-in-expressjs-4) parameters.
1. **At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?** At the very [beginning](https://scotch.io/tutorials/learn-to-use-the-new-router-in-expressjs-4): you can call an express.Router() function, apply routes to it, and then tell the application to use those routes.
1. **What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response.”** When your code is already in a [finished state](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7042340/error-cant-set-headers-after-they-are-sent-to-the-client), but you're trying to edit something that's already been sent.



- **Middleware -** Functions that have access to the [request/response](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) objects, and the next middleware function in the req/res cycle. *Middleware must be placed before the routes!*
- **Request Object -** the HTTP [request](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req) that has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, etc.
- **Response Object -** the HTTP [response](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res) that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.
- **Application Middelware -** app.USE and app.METHOD [functions](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html#middleware.application).
- **Routing Middleware -** logs [requests](https://scotch.io/tutorials/learn-to-use-the-new-router-in-expressjs-4) to the console. It's "a way to do something before a request is processed."
