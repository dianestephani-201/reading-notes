# Class 04
A linked list is a sequence of nodes linked together, which is what we saw previously in a class whiteboard example. Each node references the next node. For and forEach loops aren't usable in linked lists, but the "next" value refers to the next node. The best approach to traversing a linked list is by using a while loop, to continually check that the next node isn't null.Â Linked lists are linear data structures, meaning that order matters when constructing and traversing them. The important thing to remember about linked lists is that that allow the allocation of memory throughout. When we create an array in JavaScript, the array is composed of X amount of bytes in one continuous block. When we create a linked list in C#, we don't need the entire amount of memory in one place...we can allocate different amounts to different parts of the list.
