## HTML
### Chapter 15: Layout
- CSS treats HTML elements as if they were inside their own boxes. Boxes can be block-level or inline. Block-level elements start on a new line, while inline elements flow in between surrounding text.
- If a block-element is inside another block-level element, the outer layer is known as the containing or parent element.
- Elements can be placed in various positions to alter the page. Floating elements remove an element from the normal flow of the page and position it to the far left or right of a containing box.
- Static: the default flow.
- Relative: moves an element in relation to where it would have been in a normal flow.
- Absolute: the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page (as in, they act as if it's not there).
- Fixed: When a user scrolls down the page, this element stays in the same place.
- Overlapping elements/z-index: Z-index value is a number. An element with 10 will appear over the top of one with 5. 
- Stacking context: blocks have been stacked on top of each other on a z-axis. Equivalent of "bringing to the front" or "sending to the back."
- Float: can take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.
- Different screen sizes mean designs need to work on a range of different sized screens.
