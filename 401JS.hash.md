# Hash Maps
- Data structure that use key/value pairs: store the key, quickly retrieve the value.
- Algorithms take an incoming string and convert it to a new value for security purposes.
- Each index in the hash table array contains a bucket, meaning multiple key/value pairs?
- When more than one key gets hashed to the same location, a collision occurs.
- Hash maps use a function to place each item in a precise index location, based off its key.
- Hash function takes a key and returns an integer.
