1. **What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?** Rather than transferring a large file as a single block, [transferring smaller packets](https://techterms.com/definition/packet#:~:text=A%20packet%20is%20a%20small,(or%20data)%20being%20transferred.) is more reliable.
1. **UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?** 
1. **Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?** Yes, because they're used for [multiple](https://techterms.com/definition/socket) kinds of network protocols.
1. **Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?** No, but one server can listen to multiple sockets. 
1. **Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?** Yes?

- **OSI Model -** [Open Systems Interconnection Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/layers-of-osi-model/), with 7 layers that each have specific functions to perform.
- **TCP Model -** [Transmission Control Protocol Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/), containing 4 layers: proccess/application, host-to-host/transport, internet, network access/link.
- **UDP -** [User Datagram Protocol](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/UDP-User-Datagram-Protocol#:~:text=UDP%20(User%20Datagram%20Protocol)%20is,provided%20by%20the%20receiving%20party.), enables the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the receiving party.
- **Packets -** A small amount of [data](https://techterms.com/definition/packet#:~:text=A%20packet%20is%20a%20small,(or%20data)%20being%20transferred.) sent over a network.
- **Socket -** Opens a program's network connection, [allowing data](https://techterms.com/definition/socket) to be read and written over the network.
