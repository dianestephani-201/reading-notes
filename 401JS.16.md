# Event Driven Applications

1. **Why is access control important?** This allows different users to have different levels of control over an application.
1. **Describe an application that would need access control.** Reddit: any user can post, but there are designated moderators and administrators in each subreddit. The average user cannot moderate comments in a post, or delete posts that another user created. 
1. **What is a role used for?** A role is assigned to determine what level of permission a user has.
1. **Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?** If [scalability](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~mvanier/hacking/rants/scalable_computer_programming_languages.html) in this case refers to a server handling large amounts of work without experiencing a ton of strain, role-based access control is less overwhelming to the server because there's only a set amount of people who are able to make major changes to an application, and make the server do heavy-lifting. Average users won't have permissions to do anything that's too overwhelming for the server.  

- **Authorization -** the "what is this person allowed to do" role described in lecture.
- **Role Based Access Control -** Users are given different levels of control based on their assigned role.
- **Capabilities -** what a user is capable of doing with their given permissions.
