1. **How does route prefixing work with an external routing module?** The routes are placed in a [separate file](https://medium.com/@shairez/angular-routing-a-better-pattern-for-large-scale-apps-f2890c952a18) for organizational purposes, and are exported to be used in other files.
1. **When routing, what’s the difference between app.get('/data/:id') and app.get('/data/:name')?** The former gets data ID numbers, and the latter retrieves data names.
1. **Explain how Express handles routing conflicts?** The value of the [child element](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#router.param) takes precedence. 
1. **What are the ways that a browser can send “data” or request variables to an HTTP server?** Via an [HTTP request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Client-Server_overview#:~:text=Web%20browsers%20communicate%20with%20web,HTTP%20Request%20to%20the%20server.) through forms, searches, etc.
