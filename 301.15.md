### Diversity and Inclusion
- In 1984, 37% of computer science graduates were women. This number declined dramatcially as the decade progressed, and the industry has yet to recover. 
- According to Glassdoor, 11 out of 25 of the best-paying jobs are technology related. 
- Early computers in the mid '80s were used for playing games, and these were marketed for men. 
- The Apple PC released during that time was marketed specifically to boys, and the marketing campaign mocked girls' inferior computer skills. 
- The market for video games became oversaturated around 1983, and marketers attempted to rebuild the industry by leveraging what their research showed as their remaining small audience: boys.
- "It's no coincidence that the console touted to have saved the industry was called a GameBoy."
- In 1995, first-year computer science students were surveyed at Carnegie-Mellon. Men were more familiar with programming languages and knew enough to test out of the intro class. Women didn't achieve the same results, and usually ended up opting out of computer-related classes early on. 
- "Women start out so far behind that they often can't catch up."
- Women are 40% more likely to leave careers in technology. 
- Women often feel isolated and excluded from the lack of female roles in tech, and only 38% of women get their ideas endorsed by leadership. 
- Nearly a third of women want to quit their jobs within the first year.
