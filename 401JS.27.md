# Props and State
 1. **Does a deployed React application require a server?** Yes, but it doesn't require an express server.
 1. **Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?** React has its own [testing library](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html) that allows you to test React components without relying on their implementation details, so it's easier to refactor.
 1. **What does npm run build do?** It's a [CLI command](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43664200/what-is-the-difference-between-npm-install-and-npm-run-build#:~:text=npm%20run%20build%20%20is%20also,json) that allows you to run custom scripts with the name specified in place of "command-name."
 1. **Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application.** [Style guide](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-structure-your-react-app-98c48e102aad) attached.

 - **BDD -** Behavior Driven Development is an [evolution of TDD](https://automationpanda.com/2019/03/19/what-is-bdd-and-how-do-we-practice-it/): instead of just writing unit tests and watching them fail, BDD uses feature/acceptance tests and unit tests.
 - **Acceptance Tests -** While unit tests are good for small pieces of code, [acceptance tests](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4139095/unit-tests-vs-acceptance-tests) can tell if the overall code is working.
 - **Mounting -** When React builds a component for the first time and [builds the initial DOM](https://reacttraining.com/blog/mount-vs-render/#:~:text=Here's%20a%20brief%20tldr%3B,initial%20DOM%20from%20those%20instructions.) from those instructions.
 - **Build -** The [process that converts files](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/automated-build/#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20software,(such%20as%20jar%2C%20zip)) and assets under the developer's responsibility into a software product in its final form.
