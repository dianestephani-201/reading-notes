1. **Name 3 advantages to [Test Driven Development](https://leantesting.com/test-driven-development/#:~:text=Now%2C%20let%E2%80%99s%20take%20a%20look%20at%20some%20of,essentials%20and%20avoid%20the%20superfluous.%20More%20items...%20).** It can help identify bugs more quickly, tests can make code easier to understand, it's easier to maintain and refactor code if needed.
1. **In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?**
1. **What is one downside of Test Driven Development?** It can require a lot of [time and effort](https://leantesting.com/test-driven-development/#:~:text=Now%2C%20let%E2%80%99s%20take%20a%20look%20at%20some%20of,essentials%20and%20avoid%20the%20superfluous.%20More%20items...%20) up front, making development feel like a slower process.
1. **Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?**
1. **Name a use case for a static method.** [Static methods](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_class_static.asp) are called directly on the class without creating an instance or object of the class.
1. **Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves.**


- **Functional programming -** the [process of building software](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0) by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.
- **Pure function -** always [returns the same outputs](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0) (when given the same inputs) and has no side effects.
- **Higher order function -** a function that [takes a function as an argument](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0), and/or returns a function. 
- **Immutable state -** an item [cannot be modified](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0) after it's created.
- **Object -** a [collection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#:~:text=JavaScript%20is%20designed%20on%20a,is%20known%20as%20a%20method.) of properties.
- **Object-oriented programming -** a [programming paradigm with objects](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0) as attributes or properties, and code as methods.
- **Class -** a [template for creating objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)) that provides initial values.
- **Prototype -** when [new objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype#Computer_programming/computer_science) are produced by cloning existing objects.
- **Super -** used to [call the constructor](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_class_super.asp#:~:text=Definition%20and%20Usage,read%20our%20JavaScript%20Classes%20Tutorial.) of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods.
- **Inheritance -** methods from the base class are [copied into derived classes](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/javascript/inheritance-in-javascript#:~:text=Inheritance%20is%20an%20important%20concept,supported%20by%20using%20prototype%20object.&text=The%20following%20is%20a%20Student%20class%20that%20inherits%20Person%20class.).
- **Constructor -** a method to [create and initialize objects](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_constructor_class.asp) within a class.
- **Instance -** the occurrance of an [object](https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-instance-of-object-in-JavaScript#:~:text=An%20%E2%80%9Cinstance%E2%80%9D%20means%20a%20reference,it's%20made%20that%20is%20different.).
- **Context -** Context is the [value of the "this" keyword](https://towardsdatascience.com/javascript-context-this-keyword-9a78a19d5786) when referring to the object that "owns" the executing code. Global context is when an item is usable anywhere in the file, whereas local context is when an item is only usable within the function it occurs.
- **This -** Refers to the object that "owns" the executing code. See above.
- **Test Driven Development -** the idea of [writing automated tests](https://leantesting.com/test-driven-development/#:~:text=Now%2C%20let%E2%80%99s%20take%20a%20look%20at%20some%20of,essentials%20and%20avoid%20the%20superfluous.%20More%20items...%20) before writing code.
- **Jest -** a JavaScript [testing framework](https://jestjs.io/).
- **Continuous Integration -** code changes made by different developers are [merged into the main code branch](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/what-is-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery/#:~:text=Continuous%20integration%20is%20usually%20the%20process%20when%20code,not%20divert%20or%20impact%20the%20main%20code%20branch.) as soon as possible.
- **Unit test -** the [automatic tests](https://leantesting.com/test-driven-development/#:~:text=Now%2C%20let%E2%80%99s%20take%20a%20look%20at%20some%20of,essentials%20and%20avoid%20the%20superfluous.%20More%20items...%20) used in TDD.
