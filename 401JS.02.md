1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development.
1. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
1. What is one downside of Test Driven Development?
1. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
1. **Name a use case for a static method.** Static methods are called directly on the class without creating an instance or object of the class.
1. Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves.

- **Functional programming -** the [process of building software](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0) by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.
- **Pure function -** always [returns the same outputs](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0) (when given the same inputs) and has no side effects.
- **Higher order function -** a function that [takes a function as an argument](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0), and/or returns a function. 
- **Immutable state -** an item [cannot be modified](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0) after it's created.
- **Object -** a [collection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#:~:text=JavaScript%20is%20designed%20on%20a,is%20known%20as%20a%20method.) of properties.
- **Object-oriented programming -** a [programming paradigm with objects](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0) as attributes or properties, and code as methods.
- **Class -** a [template for creating objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)) that provides initial values.
- **Prototype -** when [new objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype#Computer_programming/computer_science) are produced by cloning existing objects.
- **Super -** used to [call the constructor](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_class_super.asp#:~:text=Definition%20and%20Usage,read%20our%20JavaScript%20Classes%20Tutorial.) of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods.
- **Inheritance -** 
- **Constructor -** a method to [create and initialize objects](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_constructor_class.asp) within a class.
- **Instance -**
- **Context -**
- **This -**
- **Test Driven Development -**
- **Jest -**
- **Continuous Integration -**
- **Unit test -**
