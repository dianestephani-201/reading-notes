## HTML
### Chapter 4: Links
- Links are used to link to other web pages, link to other sites, or to link in and out of email. 
- Links are created using the \<a href=""> element with a closing \</a> tag. The link goes between the quotes in the opening tag. The text the user would see and click on goes between the opening and closing tags. 
- For larger websites, you can organize your code by putting pages for the same section into a folder. 
- Relative URLs are a shorthand way to link pages within your own website. 
- A "mailto" link can be created to open a user's email system and send a message to a specific address. \<a href=\"mailto:diane.stephani@gmail.com">Email me here.\</a> 
- Links can open up a new window if a target="_blank" is added next to the URL.
- You can link to a specific part of a page if needed. An example would be a Wikipedia page posting a table of contents at the top, with each item linking you to the appropriate part of the page. You need to identify the specific part of the page you want to link to by assigning id attributes. The value of the attribute should start with a letter or an underscore. 

### Chapter 15: Layout
- CSS treats HTML elements as if they were inside their own boxes. Boxes can be block-level or inline. Block-level elements start on a new line, while inline elements flow in between surrounding text. 
- If a block-element is inside another block-level element, the outer layer is known as the containing or parent element.
- Elements can be placed in various positions to alter the page. Floating elements remove an element from the normal flow of the page and position it to the far left or right of a containing box. 

## JavaScript
### Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, & Objects
- A function is a group of statements that perform a specific task. 
- function giveExample() {
  document.write('Hello!');
}
- After declaring a function, you can "call" it to run its code.

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
- Pair Programming involves one person speaking out loud and "navigating" while the other person is "driving" and inputting what's spoken into the computer. 
- PP is more efficient because it's easier for both users to catch mistakes in the code. It takes a little longer, but it produces high quality code that won't require a ton of troubleshooting or debugging later. 
- The whole purpose of PP is collaboration. Students who work together learn from each other, and collaboration helps improve social skills. People could have different coding styles and still work well together if they have good communication. 
- Programmers already familiar with PP have an advantage both at the job interview and on the first day of the job after hire. Recruiters want to know that they're hiring someone with good communication skills who works well with others.
