### Chapter 4: Links
- Links are used to link to other web pages, link to other sites, or to link in and out of email. 
- Links are created using the \<a href=""> element with a closing \</a> tag. The link goes between the quotes in the opening tag. The text the user would see and click on goes between the opening and closing tags. 
- For larger websites, you can organize your code by putting pages for the same section into a folder.
