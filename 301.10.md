### Article: The Call Stack Defined on MDN
- A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place in a script that uses multiple functions.
- When a function is called, the interpreter adds it to the call stack, then begins carrying out the function.
- Any functions called by that function are added to the stack further up, and they run when their calls are reached.
- When the current function is finished, it's taken off the stack.
- If the stack takes up more than its assigned space, a "stack overflow" error occurs.
