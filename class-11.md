### Chapter 19: Practical Information
- Searching Engine Optimization (SEO) is a tool used in marketing to help a website appear closer to the top of search engine results. Figure out which terms people are likely to use in a search engine to find your site, then use these terms in the right areas of your site to increase the likelihood of a search engine displaying your link.
- SEO is split into on page techniques and off page techniques. On page techniques are methods used directly on your web page to improve its rating in search engines. Off page techniques look at the number of other sites that link to yours. 
- Search engines also look at the words between the opening and closing \<a> tags; if the text in the link contains keywords, your site could appear to be more relevant. 
- There are 7 places that keywords should appear for on page techniques: page title, url/web address, headings, text, link text, image alt text, and page descriptions.
- Search engines will penalize you for certain techniques. Example: adding text in the same color as the background of the page.
- Analytics help assess the traffic on your web page.
