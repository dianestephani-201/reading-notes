# OAuth

1. **Why is authentication important?** Authentication is important to ensure that the [right people](https://techterms.com/definition/authentication#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20authentication%20is%20the,log%20in%20to%20a%20website.) are able to access certain information. An example is entering your username and password to log in to an account.
1. **Why should we be careful about storing a userâ€™s password?** If we store a user's password with each character corresponding to the same combination of characters in our database, someone could figure out what characters each of our combos represent and figure out all the passwords in the database.
1. **What is the difference between hashing and encryption?** Hashing converts one value to another, but encryption converts data to an unrecognizable form. Hashing would be turning my password "cat" into something like "drv" to hide what it really is, but encryption would be storing that password as "d52k2" and storing each password as something else: the letter "c" wouldn't always correspond to the letter "d" in encryption, but it would in hashing.
1. **What is the difference between encryption and encoding?** One can decode, but one cannot "decrypt." 
1. **What is a token used for?** Quote via John: "The token represents you as though you are logged in." If we store the token incorrectly, someone could download the database and log in without a password.


- **authentication -** the process of verifying a user's [identity](https://techterms.com/definition/authentication#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20authentication%20is%20the,log%20in%20to%20a%20website.), usually via a username and password.
- **authorization -** a method to determine [access levels](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/authorization#:~:text=Definition%3A%20Authorization%20is%20a%20security,programs%2C%20data%20and%20application%20features.&text=Key%20factors%20contain%20user%20type,and%20related%20actions%20and%20roles.) to system resources.
