## HTML
### Chapter 2: Text
- Headings are added using the h element in HTML. A number can be added such as h1, with h6 being the maximum. As the numbers increase, the size of the heading decreases.
- Paragraphs are represented using a p element.
- Bold and italics are added using b and i elements, respectively.
- Superscript and subscript are added with sup and sub, respectively. 
- For readability, people writing web pages can add extra spaces or start new elements on new lines. If there are 2 or more spaces next to each other, the browser only displays one space. A line break is also only treated as one space. This is called **white space collapsing**.
- Line breaks are made with a 
br / element, and horizontal breaks are created with a hr / element.
- Semantic markup elements are used to add extra information to a page without modifying the structure of the page.
- The strong element is for text that requires a strong emphasis.
- em indicates that the emphasis changes the meaning of the sentence.
- A blockquote is an element used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. The p element is still used inside the blockquote element.
- For shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph, the q element is used. 
- abbr is used to represent acronyms or abbreviations, with a title attribute on the opening tag to specify the full term.
- Citations and definitions are labeled with cite and dfn respectively. 
- The address element contains contact details for the author of the page.
- ins is used to specify when content has been inserted into a document.
- del can show text that was deleted from a document.
- s is used as a strikethrough.

### Chapter 10: Introducing CSS
- CSS is used to create rules that control the way the contents of each "box" on a page are displayed.
- To use external CSS, a link element is used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the appropriate CSS style. href specifies the path, type specifies the type of document, and rel specifices the relationship between the HTML page and the file it's linked to.
- For internal CSS, a style element is used.
- There are multiple CSS selectors to specify the target text to follow a specific style. The selectors include universal, type, class, ID, child, descendant, adjacent sibling, and general sibling.
- If 2 or more rules apply to the same element, there's a specific order in which rule will take precedence. If 2 selectors are identical, the last one wins out. If one selector is more specific, that one wins. If an !important property is added, that one wins.
- Font is something inherited by child elements, but color properties are not.

## JavaScript
### Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions
- A statement is an individual instruction that ends with a semicolon. 
- Comments are written to explain what code does, using //.
- Variables are temporarily stored data that contain necessary bits of information to complete a task.
- The value is what you'd like the variable to store.
- A boolean is a value of "true" or "false." Variables can be used to store a boolean.]- The value of a variable can be changed later in the document.
- An array is a variable that stores a list of values, such as the days of the week.
- An expression results in a single value. An expression assigns a value to a variable, or uses 2 or more values to return a single value.
- Operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 
- A + sign represents a string operator, used to join strings on either side of it.
