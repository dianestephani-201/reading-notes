# Redux - Asynchronous Actions

1. **How granular should your reducers be?** Having higher granularity leads to a better UI experience, because [fewer components](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide) will need to re-render when state changes.
1. **Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched?** Con, debugging can get [more difficult](https://redux.js.org/faq/actions) if some of your actions are changing state.
1. **Name a strategy for preventing the above.** Have [many reducer functions](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide) that handle the same action separately. 

- **Store -** Each store holds a different [area of domain data](https://redux.js.org/faq/store-setup).
- **combineReducers -** a helper function that turns an object whose values are different reducing functions, into a single reducing function.
