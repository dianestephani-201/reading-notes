# Component Composition

1. **Can a parent component access the state of a child component?** Yes, through callback functions.
1. **What can be passed along in a prop variable?** Objects with key/value pairs.
1. **How can a child component “know” the state of another component?** By passing a component's state to its [child components as props](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/can-a-component-access-the-state-of-another-component/394157), or you can have components share a common ancestor and access the same state in a similar manner.

- **Component props -** accept [arbitrary inputs](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html), or props, and return React elements describing what should appear on screen.
- **Component state -** an object that holds [information that may change](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-state-react/#:~:text=What%20is%20State%3F,the%20lifetime%20of%20the%20component.) over the lifetime of the component.
- **Application state -** everything [necessary](https://thedaylightstudio.com/blog/2018/03/14/what-is-state-in-web-application-development) to keep an application running.
