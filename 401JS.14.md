# Access Control

1. **When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?** Bearer authorization adds an extra layer of security by producing a token, so basic is used when you don't want a token.
1. **What does the JSON Web Token package do?** Allows parties to [securely transmit](https://jwt.io/introduction/) information as a JSON object.
1. **What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?** Secrets shouldn't be embedded in code or any other part of the system, other than in the container itself (the .env file).

- **encryption -** the process of converting data to an unrecognizable form.
- **token -** displays an identification code used to log in to a network.
- **bearer -** "a [cryptic string](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/), usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources."
- **secret -** can be opened only when specific conditions are fulfilled.
- **JSON Web Token -** a compact and self-contained way for [securely transmitting](https://jwt.io/introduction/) information as a JSON object.
