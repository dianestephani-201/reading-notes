### Article: Responsive Web Design
- Responsive Web Design is how websites are created for multiple devices, desktop computers vs. mobile.
- RWD is the practice of making websites viewable on any device.
- Flexible layouts contain a flexible grid capable of resizing to any width.
- Viewports width, height, minimum width & height, maximum width & height.
- Flexible layouts don't use fixed measurement units such as inches or pixels.
- "The formula is based around taking the target width of an element and dividing it by the width of [its] parent element. The result is the relative width of the target element."


### Article: All About Floats
- Floats take an element out of the regular flow of the page.
- Images can be floated left or right, and the text will "wrap around" them.
- Values for float property: left, right, none, inherit. 
- Inherit will assume the float value from the parent element.
- In addition to images, floats are used to create entirely different web layouts when applied to various elements.
- If a floated image is resized, the accompanying text can also resize automatically.
- "An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float."
- Clear values: both, left, right, none, inherit. Inherit is not supported in Internet Explorer for clears.
- If a parent element contains nothing but floats, the size of the parent will collapse. "We fix it by clearing the float after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container."
- Floats are known for being fragile, particularly from bugs in Internet Explorer 6.
- "Pushdown is a symptom of an element inside a floated item being wider than the float itself (typically an image)." Using "overflow: hidden" will cut off the excess.
- Double margin bug
- 3px Jog
- Bottom margin bug
