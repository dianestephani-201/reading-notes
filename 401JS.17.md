1. **Given the examples of front-end events such as button click, window resize, form submit, etc, what are some examples of back-end events?** Our CAPS lab is the best example. We wrote a function to generate a new order every 5 seconds, and then have other functions listening for that action to complete so they can complete their own actions: updating a status of a package from "in transit" to "delivered."
1. **Why are events sometimes better than asynchronous actions with callbacks?** Async/await is better when you're waiting for a specific result from a previous block of code. One function can emit an event that multiple other functions are listening to at the same time, where as I think an async can have only one await.
1. **What does an EventEmitter instance do?** It's an object that emits an event when something happens, and other objects called listeners are listening for that event to happen.
1. **When is a programâ€™s call stack, event queue, and event loop active?** 

- **Observer Pattern -** objects subscribe to an event and are notified when it occurs.
- **Listener -** An object listening for a specific event to occur.
- **Event Handler -** a block of code that runs when an event fires.
- **Event Driven Programming -** when the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs.
- **Event Loop -** continuously checks the call stack to see if there's any function that needs to run.
- **Event Queue -** sends new functions to the track to be processed.
- **Call Stack -** keeps track of all operations in line to be executed.
- **Emit/Raise/Trigger -** an object that emits events.
- **Subscribe -** objects subscribe to an event.
- **database -** a structured set of data.
