## Article: Unit Testing
- Unit tests work with specific parts of your code to make sure each part works.
- With C#, a unit is a method. A unit test ensures that teach method works.
- Arrange, Act, Assert: arrange necessary items to run the experiment, act to invoke the method, and assert what needs to be tested.
- Each test should have its own separate setup and teardown, independent of other tests.
- "If you find yourself laboring heavily to get a class and method setup so that you can test it, you have a design problem." 
- "Setup heavy tests" are "brittle tests." 

## Repo: Art of Readme
- The README is meant to be read before one proceeds with an application.
- This file describes what the project is, what it looks like when it's working, how to use it, and any other relevant information.
- The ideal README is "as short as it can be, without being too short."
- Use multiple pages to create more detailed documentation, so the README is left brief.
- Topics for the file include: name, one-liner, usage, API info, installation, and license.
