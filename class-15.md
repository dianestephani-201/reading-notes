### Article: What Google Learned
Google conducted Project Aristotle, dedicated to discovering how to put together the perfect team. They found that teams who were bad at one thing were typically bad at everything, and those who succeeded in one of the tasks were usually successful in all of them. Eventually they concluded that the deciding factor in the success of a team was *how team members treated one another*. Each group had both spoken and unspoken behaviors that they all considered normal. The right norms could raise a group's collective intelligence, and the wrong ones could hinder their progress. The group's collective intelligence was more important than the intelligence of each individual. 

All good teams generally shared the same two behaviors: they practiced good turn-taking in conversation and each member contributed evenly, and they were more skilled at determining a speaker's feelings based on their nonverbal cues. Conversational turn-taking and average social sensitivity are two aspects of what is called "psychological safety." This is "a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up." It's important for team members to feel comfortable being themselves, and this is established in an environment with mutual respect and interpersonal trust.
