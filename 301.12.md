### Article: Partials
- Partials are for reusing the same HTML across multiple views.
- In the example used, 2 HTML files were created: 1 for the header text, and one for the footer.
- Both files can act as templates whenver a new "post" is made. 
- <% %> used to insert the partial files wherever they're needed.
