1. **Why would a developer choose to make data models?** To analyze data requirements such as scalability, performance, and consistency.
1. **What purpose do CRUD operations serve?** Create, Read, Update, Delete. These are used to [manage items](https://www.sqlshack.com/creating-using-crud-stored-procedures/#:~:text=CRUD%20represents%20an%20acronym%20for,SELECT%2C%20UPDATE%2C%20and%20DELETE.) in SQL databases.
1. **What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?** Postgres is an [object-relational database](https://www.postgresql.org/about/#:~:text=PostgreSQL%20is%20a%20powerful%2C%20open,the%20most%20complicated%20data%20workloads.), and Mongo is a [document-oriented database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB#:~:text=MongoDB%20is%20a%20cross%2Dplatform,Side%20Public%20License%20(SSPL).). 
1. **What is Mongoose and why do we need it?** An object data modeling [library](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-mongoose#:~:text=Mongoose%20is%20an%20object%20data,js%20application%20on%20Heroku.) used to create a structured environment for data in MongoDB.
1. **Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.**



- **Database -** a structured set of [data](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk01W0mOiSgfN3NQUQjS4_B8LNsg42g:1597646475916&q=Dictionary&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONQesSoyi3w8sc9YSmZSWtOXmMU4-LzL0jNc8lMLsnMz0ssqrRiUWJKzeNZxMqFEAMA7_QXqzcAAAA&zx=1597646499392#dobs=database) in a computer.
- **Data Model -** a model that [organizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model) elements of data.
- **CRUD -** Create, Read, Update, Delete.
- **Schema -** a collection of [data objects](https://www.edureka.co/blog/schema-in-sql/#:~:text=in%20SQL%20Server%3F-,A%20Schema%20in%20SQL%20is%20a%20collection%20of%20database%20objects,have%20single%20or%20multiple%20schemas.) associated with a database.
- **Sanitize -** to use [software to check data](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/sanitized-data.htm#:~:text=Sanitize%20and%20Sanitized%20data%20is,be%20harmful%20to%20the%20system.&text=If%20its%20inputs%20are%20not,such%20as%20an%20SQL%20injection.) for information that could be harmful to the system.
- **Structured Query Language -** the [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) used to manage data in a database.
- **Non SQL (noSQL) -** databases that come in a [variety of types](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained), such as document, key-value, wide-column, and graph.
- **MongoDB -** a [document database](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/) designed for easy development and scaling.
- **Mongoose -** a library used to structure data in MongoDB.
- **Record -** all of the [data for one item](https://www.cengage.com/school/corpview/RegularFeatures/DatabaseTutorial/db_elements/db_elements2.htm#:~:text=A%20record%20is%20composed%20of,rows%20in%20the%20database%20table. in a database.
- **Document -** [compiled data](https://aws.amazon.com/nosql/document/#:~:text=A%20document%20database%20is%20a,use%20in%20their%20application%20code.), such as a JSON file.
- **Object Relation Mapping (ORM) -** a technique for [converting data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) between incompatible systems.
