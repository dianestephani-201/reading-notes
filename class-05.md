### Chapter 5: Images
- Choosing the right images for a site should be based on the following criteria: images need to be relevant, convey information, convey the right mood, be instantly recognizable, and fit the color palette of the site. 
- Images should also not violate any copyright laws. Websites such as gettyimages contain photos that are free to use without violating copyrights.
- When building a website from scratch, create a folder that contains all the images used by the site. 
- Images can be added with an \<img src=""> element. 
- Height and width of the image need to be specified using pixels.
- In older HTML code, images could be aligned left/right or vertically. HTML5 has removed this feature and moved it over to CSS, but the old method is still seen when reading older code.
- When creating images, key things to remember are saving images in the right format, at the right size, and that the size is measured in pixels.
- Photos with a lot of different colors should be saved as JPEGs. 
- Photos with few colors or large areas of the same color should be saved as PNGs or GIFs. 

### Chapter 11: Color
- Foreground color is the color of the text inside an element.
- Background color sets the background for an HTML box. 
- Colors on the computer screen are created by mixing various amounts of red, green, and blue. 
- There must be enough contrast between foreground and background colors to ensure that text is visible. 
- Opacity was introduced in CSS3 to changed the opacity of an element (example: the background of a block).
- CSS3 allows one to specify colors using HSL: hue, saturation, and lightness values. Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. Lightness is the amount of white. 


### Chapter 12: Text
- Serif: Extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters.
- Sans-serif: Straight ends to letters, cleaner design.
- Monospace: Every letter is the same width.
- Weight: The amount of emphasis on a word or letter.
- Style: Normal, Italic, Oblique. Italic fonts have a cursive apsect, oblique fonts have the normal text style at an angle.
- Stretch: Condensed, regular, extended.
- It's important to understand that a browser can only display a specific font if it's installed on that user's computer.
- Typefaces specified within CSS along with font size.
- Sizes of text measured in pixels, percentages, or EMs.
- Text shadow is used more commonly despite not having support in all browsers. It creates a shadow behind the displayed text.
