- Pure functions return the same result if given the same arguments, and does not cause observable side effects. 
- The example function given is impure because it uses a global object that was not passed as a parameter. This is remedied by adding the object as a parameter. 
- Functions that rely on a randomly generated number are never pure.
- Pure functions are easier to test in different contexts.
- Immutable data cannot be changed after it's created. 
- To change immutable data, you have to create a new object with the new value.
- Pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency.
