# Linked Lists
- A linked list is a sequence of connected nodes.
- Each node also references the next node in the link.
- *Singly* refers to the number of instances a node has, one in this case.
- *Doubly* refers to two instances in the node, referencing both the previous and the next.
- The *head* is the first node in a list.
- The *current* is the current node being referenced.
- We don't use for or foreach loops to transverse a node; instead, we depend on the "next" value to lead us into the next node.
- The best way to transverse a linked list is through a while loop, which allows us to continually check that the value of the next node is not null.
