### Article: Templating with Mustache
- "Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source."
- The template is HTML markup with tags that either insert variables or run programming logic.
- "The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client."
- Mustache "works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object."
- No if statements, else clauses, or for loops.
- "Mustache is a specification for a templating language."


### Article: Complete Guide to Flexbox
- Flexbox is a "way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”)."
- Flexbox aims to give "the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow."
- Flexbox is a whole module rather than a single property.
- Main axis - The primary axis along which flex items are laid out, not necessarily horizontal.
- Main-start/end - "The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end."
- Main size - "A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size. The flex item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’ property, whichever is in the main dimension."
- Cross axis - "The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction."
- Cross-start/end - "Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side."
- Cross size - "The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. The cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in the cross dimension."
