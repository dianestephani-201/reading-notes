# Class 03
- A type defined as a class is a reference type.
- Classes are declared using the class keyword and a unique identifier.
- A class is a type of object.
- A constructor is called when a class is created.
- If a constructor isn't provided for a class, C# automatically creates one that instantiates the object and sets variables to default values.
- Static constructors don't have parameters.
- Properties allow a class to get and set values.
