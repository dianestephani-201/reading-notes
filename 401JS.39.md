# Redux

1. **What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?** Using lifecycle methods, such as componentWill/DidMount.
1. **When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?** Side effects of the async action?

- **Middleware -** Provides services to applications outside of what the OS offers.
- **Thunk -** Verifies if an action is a function, and in which cases to execute it.
