### Article: File & Stream I/O
- File and Stream Input/Output is the transfer of data either to or from a storage medium.
- The .NET Framework allows both reading and writing, synchronously or asynchronously, on data streams and files.
- System I/O namespaces also can also perform compression and decompression on files and enable communication through pipes and serial ports.
- "A file is an ordered and named collection of bytes that has persistent storage. When you work with files, you work with directory paths, disk storage, and file and directory names."
- "A stream is a sequence of bytes that you can use to read from and write to a backing store, which can be one of several storage mediums (for example, disks or memory)."
- "Just as there are several backing stores other than disks, there are several kinds of streams other than file streams, such as network, memory, and pipe streams."
- "File - provides static methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening files, and helps create a FileStream object."
- "FileInfo - provides instance methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening files, and helps create a FileStream object."
- "Directory - provides static methods for creating, moving, and enumerating through directories and subdirectories."
- "DirectoryInfo - provides instance methods for creating, moving, and enumerating through directories and subdirectories."
- "Path - provides methods and properties for processing directory strings in a cross-platform manner."
- The stream class supports reading and writing bytes.
- Streams have 3 fundamental operations: reading, writing, and seeking.
- "Reading - transferring data from a stream into a data structure, such as an array of bytes."
- "Writing - transferring data to a stream from a data source."
- "Seeking - querying and modifying the current position within a stream."
- Reading and writing should be performed asynchronously in order for the app to remain responsive to the user.
